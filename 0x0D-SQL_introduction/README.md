If you have some issues to upgrade to 5.7, don’t hesitate to cleanup your server of any MySQL packages: sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common
Use “container-on-demand” to run MySQL

    Ask for container Ubuntu 14.04 - Python 3.4
    Connect via SSH
    OR connect via the Web terminal
    In the container, you should start MySQL before playing with it:

$ service mysql start
 * MySQL Community Server 5.7.8-rc is started
$
$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -uroot -p my_database
Enter password: 
Database
information_schema
mysql
performance_schema
sys
$
